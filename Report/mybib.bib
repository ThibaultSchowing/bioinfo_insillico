	abstract = {Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation of denatured proteins in vitro and are thought to support folding of diverse proteins in vivo. Chaperones may have some selectivity for their substrate proteins, but knowledge of particular in vivo substrates is still poor. We here show that yeast Rot1, an essential, type-I ER membrane protein functions as a chaperone. Recombinant Rot1 exhibited antiaggregation activity in vitro, which was partly impaired by a temperature-sensitive rot1-2 mutation. In vivo, the rot1-2 mutation caused accelerated degradation of five proteins in the secretory pathway via ER-associated degradation, resulting in a decrease in their cellular levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate a physical and probably transient interaction of Rot1 with four of these proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that Rot1 functions as a chaperone in vivo supporting the folding of those proteins. Their folding also requires BiP, and one of these proteins was simultaneously associated with both Rot1 and BiP, suggesting that they can cooperate to facilitate protein folding. The Rot1-dependent proteins include a soluble, type I and II, and polytopic membrane proteins, and they do not share structural similarities. In addition, their dependency on Rot1 appeared different. We therefore propose that Rot1 is a general chaperone with some substrate specificity.},

	abstract = {Vtc proteins have genetic and physical relations with the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), inﬂuence vacuolar H+ uptake and, like the V-ATPase V0 sectors, are important factors in vacuolar membrane fusion. Vacuoles from vtc1∆ and vtc4∆ mutants had slightly reduced H+-uptake activity. These defects could be separated from Vtc function in vacuole fusion, demonstrating that Vtc proteins have a direct role in membrane fusion. We analyzed their involvement in other membrane trafficking steps and in VATPase dynamics. Deletion of VTC genes did not impede endocytic trafficking to the vacuole. However, ER to Golgi trafficking and further transport to the vacuole was delayed in ∆vtc3 cells. In accordance with that, ∆vtc3 cells showed a reduced growth rate. Vtc mutations did not interfere with regulated assembly and disassembly of the V-ATPase, but they affected the number of peripheral V1 subunits associated with the vacuoles. ∆vtc3 vacuoles carried signiﬁcantly more V1 subunits, whereas ∆vtc1, ∆vtc2 and ∆vtc4 had signiﬁcantly less. The proteolytic sensitivity of the V0 subunit Vph1p was different in ∆vtc and wild-type cells in vivo, corroborating the physical interaction of Vtc proteins with the V-ATPase observed in vitro. We suggest that Vtc proteins affect the conformation of V0. They might thereby inﬂuence the stability of the VATPase holoenzyme and support the function of its V0 sector in vacuolar membrane fusion.},

	abstract = {KRE6 encodes a predicted type II membrane protein which, when disrupted, results in a slowly growing, killer toxin-resistant mutant possessing half the normal level of a structurally wild-type cell wall (1–\&gt;6)-beta-glucan (T. Roemer and H. Bussey, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:11295-11299, 1991). The mutant phenotype and structure of the KRE6 gene product, Kre6p, suggest that it may be a beta-glucan synthase component, implying that (1–\&gt;6)-beta-glucan synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is functionally redundant. To examine this possibility, we screened a multicopy genomic library for suppression of both the slow-growth and killer resistance phenotypes of a kre6 mutant and identified SKN1, which encodes a protein sharing 66\% overall identity to Kre6p. SKN1 suppresses kre6 null alleles in a dose-dependent manner, though disruption of the SKN1 locus has no effect on killer sensitivity, growth, or (1–\&gt;6)-beta-glucan levels. skn1 kre6 double disruptants, however, showed a dramatic reduction in both (1–\&gt;6)-beta-glucan levels and growth rate compared with either single disruptant. Moreover, the residual (1–\&gt;6)-beta-glucan polymer in skn1 kre6 double mutants is smaller in size and altered in structure. Since single disruptions of these genes lead to structurally wild-type (1–\&gt;6)-beta-glucan polymers, Kre6p and Skn1p appear to function independently, possibly in parallel, in (1–\&gt;6)-beta-glucan biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis requires \$200 assembly factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The preribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing defects associated with depletion of most of these factors have been characterized. However, how assembly factors drive the construction of ribonucleoprotein neighborhoods and how structural rearrangements are coupled to pre-rRNA processing are not understood. Here, we reveal ATP-independent and ATP-dependent roles of the Has1 DEAD-box RNA helicase in consecutive pre-rRNA processing and maturation steps for construction of 60S ribosomal subunits. Has1 associates with pre-60S ribosomes in an ATP-independent manner. Has1 binding triggers exonucleolytic trimming of 27SA3 prerRNA to generate the 50 end of 5.8S rRNA and drives incorporation of ribosomal protein L17 with domain I of 5.8S/25S rRNA. ATP-dependent activity of Has1 promotes stable association of additional domain I ribosomal proteins that surround the polypeptide exit tunnel, which are required for downstream processing of 27SB pre-rRNA. Furthermore, in the absence of Has1, aberrant 27S pre-rRNAs are targeted for irreversible turnover. Thus, our data support a model in which Has1 helps to establish domain I architecture to prevent pre-rRNA turnover and couples domain I folding with consecutive pre-rRNA processing steps.},

	abstract = {The integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein catalyzing the initial reaction of protein 0-glycosylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been purified to homogeneity. The 92-kDa N-glycosylated protein transfers mannose residues from dolichyl phosphate-D-mannose to specific serine/threonine residues of proteins entering the secretory pathway. This type of mannosyl transfer reaction has so far been observed only in fungal cells. Oligonucleotides derived from peptide sequences of the transferase were used to screen a genomic yeast library. A clone was isolated which contains an open reading frame of 2451 bp corresponding to an mRNA banscript of 3 kb. The predicted protein consists of 817 amino acids including three potential N-glycosylation sites. The hydropathy plot indicates a tripartite structure of the protein: an amino-terminal third and a carboxyl-terminal third, both with multiple potential transmembrane helices, and a central hydrophilic part. Expression of the clone in Eschenchia coli resulted in mannosyltransferase activity. Gene disruption led to a complete loss of in vitro mannosyltransferase activity from dolichyl phosphate-D-mannose to a peptide used as acceptor in the enzymatic assay. In vivo it was observed, however, that protein 0-mannosylation in the disruptant had decreased only to about 40-50\%, indicating the existence of an additional transferase which had not been measured by the in vitro enzyme assay.},

	abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, proteins enter the secretory pathway at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as linear polypeptides and fold after translocation across or insertion into the membrane. If correct folding fails, many proteins are O-mannosylated inside the ER by an O-mannosyltransferase, the Pmt1p–Pmt2p complex. The consequences of this modification are controversial and the cellular role of the Pmt1p–Pmt2p complex in this respect is unclear. Here, we have identified the binding partners of yeast Pmt1p and Pmt2p. These include ER chaperones involved in oxidative protein folding; the Hrd1p complex, which is involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD); and the p24 protein complex involved in ER export. The results suggest that the Pmt1p–Pmt2p complex participates in these processes. We tested this assumption in a functional assay and found that whereas the Pmt1p–Pmt2p complex promotes fast ER export of the GPI-anchored protein Gas1p, it retains the misfolded version Gas1*p and targets it to the Hrd1p complex for subsequent degradation. Our results reveal previously unknown cellular roles of the Pmt1p–Pmt2p complex in connection with the ERAD machinery and show its participation in ER protein quality control.},

Here we show that a recessive cold sensitive mutation in PDR13 coding for an Hsp70 suppressed the tom1 mutation. The pdr13 deletion mutant was sensitive to high osmolarity, just like the zuo1 deletion mutant. A zuo1 pdr13 double deletion mutant did not show additive phenotypes. Furthermore, a tagged-Zuo1p was co-immunoprecipitated with a taggedPdr13p. Taken together, we propose that Pdr13p and Zuo1p are a new pair of Hsp70:Hsp40 molecular chaperones.

	abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process that provides cells with the molecular factories for cellular protein production. Accordingly, its misregulation lies at the heart of several hereditary diseases (e.g., Diamond-Blackfan anemia). The process of ribosome assembly comprises the processing and folding of the pre-rRNA and its concomitant assembly with the ribosomal proteins. Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis relies on a large number (N 200) of non-ribosomal factors, which confer directionality and accuracy to this process. Many of these non-ribosomal factors fall into different families of energy-consuming enzymes, notably including ATP-dependent RNA helicases, AAA-ATPases, GTPases, and kinases. Ribosome biogenesis is highly conserved within eukaryotic organisms; however, due to the combination of powerful genetic and biochemical methods, it is best studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This review summarizes our current knowledge on eukaryotic ribosome assembly, with particular focus on the molecular role of the involved energy-consuming enzymes.},

	abstract = {The TOM1 gene codes for a so-called HECT protein, a putative ubiquitin ligase, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the entire gene (tom1-10) or the sequence encoding the HECT domain (tom1-2) causes temperature sensitivity for growth. Here we report the isolation of extragenic, recessive suppressors of tom1-2, which were designated tmr (for tom1 revertant) mutations. These were classi®ed into eight complementation groups and six of the genes were identi®ed: tmr1/cyr1, tmr2/sch9, tmr3/zuo1, tmr4, tmr5/mot1, tmr6/sse1, tmr7 and tmr8/kre6. These results suggested that the tom1 phenotype can be rescued by down-regulating the cAMP/PKA pathway. It was found that the temperature sensitivity of the tom1-2 mutant is indeed suppressed by multiple copies of PDE2 or BCY1, which encode negative regulators of the cAMP/PKA pathway. The MSN2 gene, which encodes a zinc-®nger transcription factor involved in the general stress response is also a multicopy suppressor of tom1. It was found that induction levels of both STRE-mediated (general stress response) and HSE-mediated gene expression (heat shock response) upon shift to high temperature are reduced by more than half in the tom1 mutant. Most of the isolated tmr mutations rescued one of the defects seen in both types of heat stress response in the tom1 mutant.},

	abstract = {A tom1-1 mutant was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At high temperatures, 60\% of the cells were arrested as dumbbell forms with a single large nucleus containing duplicated DNA and a short spindle. Electron-microscopy showed electron-dense structures scattered within the nucleus. Indirect immunoﬂuorescent microscopy revealed these structures to be fragmented nucleoli since the dotted structures were stained with anti-Nop1(ﬁbrillarin) antibody in large regions of the nuclei. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using oligo(dT ) revealed nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+RNA. We cloned TOM1 which encodes a large protein (380 kDa) with a hect (homologous to E6-AP C terminus)-domain at its C terminus. Deletions of either this hect-region or the entire gene made cellular growth temperature-sensitive. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved cysteine residue (tom1C3235A) in the hect-domain, supposed to be necessary for thioester-bond formation with ubiquitin, abolished the gene function. When a functional glutathione S-transferase (GST )-tagged hect protein was overproduced, it facilitated the protein conjugation with a myc-tagged ubiquitinRA, while this was not seen when GST-hect C3235A was overproduced. The protein conjugation with a hemagglutinin-tagged Smt3 was not aﬀected by the overproduction of GST-hect. Taken together, we suggest that Tom1 is a ubiquitin ligase. As a multi-copy suppressor of tom1, we isolated STM3/NPI46/FPR3 which encodes a nucleolar nucleolin-like protein. We discuss possible functions of Tom1 with respect to the pleiotropic defects of nuclear division, maintenance of nuclear structure, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process that provides cells with the molecular factories for cellular protein production. Accordingly, its misregulation lies at the heart of several hereditary diseases (e.g., Diamond-Blackfan anemia). The process of ribosome assembly comprises the processing and folding of the pre-rRNA and its concomitant assembly with the ribosomal proteins. Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis relies on a large number (N 200) of non-ribosomal factors, which confer directionality and accuracy to this process. Many of these non-ribosomal factors fall into different families of energy-consuming enzymes, notably including ATP-dependent RNA helicases, AAA-ATPases, GTPases, and kinases. Ribosome biogenesis is highly conserved within eukaryotic organisms; however, due to the combination of powerful genetic and biochemical methods, it is best studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This review summarizes our current knowledge on eukaryotic ribosome assembly, with particular focus on the molecular role of the involved energy-consuming enzymes.},

Impairment of proteindegradation systems, including the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome systems, has been proposed as one of the causes of the accumulation of these aberrant proteins in AD brains. Tom1 (target of Myb1) was originally identiﬁed by the induction of its expression by the v-Myb oncogene and is a part of two major protein-degradation systems. The present study was conducted by immunohistochemical and immunoﬂuorescent stainings to show that Tom1 was localized in DNs, perisomatic granules (PSGs), and NFTs in AD brains. Moreover, in DNs, Tom1 colocalized with ubiquitin, lysosomal proteins, and Tom1-related proteins (Tollip and myosin VI), which act in both protein-degradation systems via Tom1. These results indicate that Tom1 plays important roles in protein-degradation systems in AD pathogenesis.},

Here we demonstrate that excess histones associate with Rad53 in vivo, appear to undergo modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation and polyubiquitylation, before their proteolysis by the proteasome. We have identified the tyrosine 99 residue of histone H3 as being critical for the efficient ubiquitylation and degradation of this histone. We have also identified the E2 proteins Ubc4 and Ubc5, as well as the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1, as enzymes involved in the ubiquitylation of excess histones. Regulated histone proteolysis has major implications for the maintenance of epigenetic marks on chromatin, genomic stability and the packaging of sperm DNA.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.19105},
	abstract = {Overproduced yeast ribosomal protein (RP) Rpl26 fails to assemble into ribosomes and is degraded in the nucleus/nucleolus by a ubiquitin-proteasome system quality control pathway comprising the E2 enzymes Ubc4/Ubc5 and the ubiquitin ligase Tom1. tom1 cells show reduced ubiquitination of multiple RPs, exceptional accumulation of detergent-insoluble proteins including multiple RPs, and hypersensitivity to imbalances in production of RPs and rRNA, indicative of a profound perturbation to proteostasis. Tom1 directly ubiquitinates unassembled RPs primarily via residues that are concealed in mature ribosomes. Together, these data point to an important role for Tom1 in normal physiology and prompt us to refer to this pathway as ERISQ, for excess ribosomal protein quality control. A similar pathway, mediated by the Tom1 homolog Huwe1, restricts accumulation of overexpressed hRpl26 in human cells. We propose that ERISQ is a key element of the quality control machinery that sustains protein homeostasis and cellular fitness in eukaryotes.
	, 
	Ribosomes are the molecular machines in cells that produce proteins. The ribosomes themselves are composed of almost 80 different proteins that are held together by scaffolds made from molecules of RNA. Each protein is present in one copy, and so equal numbers of all proteins are needed to assemble a ribosome. However, because it takes many steps to produce a protein and biological processes are inherently imprecise, it is essentially impossible for a cell to produce exactly the same number of copies of all the proteins in a ribosome. Much research suggests that, to overcome these issues, a cell will make more of certain ribosomal proteins than it needs, and then degrade the leftovers that are not used. However, it was not clear how this happens, nor was it known what are the consequences of failing to degrade the leftovers.
	Now, Sung et al. show that yeast cells use an enzyme named Tom1 to attach a protein-marker called ubiquitin to ribosomal proteins that are made in excess and not assembled into ribosomes. The ubiquitin serves as a tag that marks proteins for degradation, and yeast cell that lack Tom1 fail to degrade any excess ribosomal proteins. Consequently, the mutant yeast become sensitive to any factors that alter the balance of the protein and RNA building blocks used to assemble ribosomes.
	The human equivalent of Tom1 is known as Huwe1, and the data of Sung et al. suggest that this enzyme acts in a similar pathway. Further experiments are now needed to explore the role of Huwe1 in greater depth, and investigate if problems with this enzyme are associated with any human diseases. Finally, working out the exactly how Tom1 recognizes unassembled ribosomal proteins will be another important challenge for future studies.},

By releasing intracellular enzymes, autolysis of Lactobacillus helveticus has important applications in cheese ripening as its extent varied from strain to strain. Nine genes coding PGHs were previously annotated in the genome of the high autolytic strain L. helveticus DPC 4571. This study was conducted to evaluate the clone diversity of the nine PGHs genes within a collection of 24 L. helveticus strains, highly diverse in terms of origin, biotope and autolytic activity. Pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis was applied to assess the genomic diversity of the 24 strains. The presence or absence of nine PGHs genes was veriﬁed for all L. helveticus strains. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence were compared for six relevant strains. Finally, gene expression was monitored by reverse transcription during growth and by zymogram for 12 strains. The nine PGHs genes are ubiquitous and transcripted early during growth. Zymograms were similar in terms of molecular size of the bands, but exhibited strain to strain variations in the number of bands revealing from 2 to 5 lytic bands per strain.},

In this review, we categorize de novo assemblers on the basis of the type of de Bruijn graphs (Hamiltonian and Eulerian) and discuss the challenges of de novo assembly for short NGS reads regarding computational complexity and assembly ambiguity. Then, we discuss how the limitations of the short reads can be overcome by using a single-molecule sequencing platform that generates long reads of up to several kilobases. In fact, the long read assembly has caused a paradigm shift in whole-genome assembly in terms of algorithms and supporting steps. We also summarize (i) hybrid assemblies using both short and long reads and (ii) overlap-based assemblies for long reads and discuss their challenges and future prospects. This review provides guidelines to determine the optimal approach for a given input data type, computational budget or genome.},

Specific biochemical or genetic data on the biosynthesis pathways of the cell wall constituents are scarce in lactic acid bacteria, but together with genomics information they indicate close similarities with those described in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, with one notable exception regarding the peptidoglycan precursor. In several species or strains of enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal D-alanine residue of the muramyl pentapeptide is replaced by D-lactate or D-serine, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. Diverse physiological functions may be assigned to the cell wall, which contribute to the technological and health-related attributes of lactic acid bacteria. For instance, phage receptor activity relates to the presence of specific substituents on teichoic acids and polysaccharides; resistance to stress (UV radiation, acidic pH) depends on genes involved in peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis; autolysis is controlled by the degree of esterification of teichoic acids with D-alanine; mucosal immunostimulation may result from interactions between epithelial cells and peptidoglycan or teichoic acids.},

	abstract = {Background: Bacterial taxonomy aims to classify bacteria based on true evolutionary events and relies on a polyphasic approach that includes phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses. Until now, complete genomes are largely ignored in taxonomy. The genus Lactobacillus consists of 173 species and many genomes are available to study taxonomy and evolutionary events.
	Results: We analyzed and clustered 98 completely sequenced genomes of the genus Lactobacillus and 234 draft genomes of 5 different Lactobacillus species, i.e. L. reuteri, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. helveticus. The core-genome of the genus Lactobacillus contains 266 genes and the pan-genome 20′800 genes. Clustering of the Lactobacillus pan- and core-genome resulted in two highly similar trees. This shows that evolutionary history is traceable in the core-genome and that clustering of the core-genome is sufficient to explore relationships. Clustering of core- and pan-genomes at species’ level resulted in similar trees as well. Detailed analyses of the core-genomes showed that the functional class “genetic information processing” is conserved in the core-genome but that “signaling and cellular processes” is not. The latter class encodes functions that are involved in environmental interactions. Evolution of lactobacilli seems therefore directed by the environment. The type species L. delbrueckii was analyzed in detail and its pan-genome based tree contained two major clades whose members contained different genes yet identical functions. In addition, evidence for horizontal gene transfer between strains of L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, and L. rhamnosus, and between species of the genus Lactobacillus is presented. Our data provide evidence for evolution of some lactobacilli according to a parapatric-like model for species differentiation.
	Conclusions: Core-genome trees are useful to detect evolutionary relationships in lactobacilli and might be useful in taxonomic analyses. Lactobacillus’ evolution is directed by the environment and HGT.},

	abstract = {Background: Escherichia coli exists in commensal and pathogenic forms. By measuring the variation of individual genes across more than a hundred sequenced genomes, gene variation can be studied in detail, including the number of mutations found for any given gene. This knowledge will be useful for creating better phylogenies, for determination of molecular clocks and for improved typing techniques.
	Results: We find 3,051 gene clusters/families present in at least 95\% of the genomes and 1,702 gene clusters present in 100\% of the genomes. The former 'soft core' of about 3,000 gene families is perhaps more biologically relevant, especially considering that many of these genome sequences are draft quality. The E. coli pan-genome for this set of isolates contains 16,373 gene clusters. A core-gene tree, based on alignment and a pan-genome tree based on gene presence/absence, maps the relatedness of the 186 sequenced E. coli genomes. The core-gene tree displays high confidence and divides the E. coli strains into the observed MLST type clades and also separates defined phylotypes.
	Conclusion: The results of comparing a large and diverse E. coli dataset support the theory that reliable and good resolution phylogenies can be inferred from the core-genome. The results further suggest that the resolution at the isolate level may, subsequently be improved by targeting more variable genes. The use of whole genome sequencing will make it possible to eliminate, or at least reduce, the need for several typing steps used in traditional epidemiology.},

In particular, PHASTER is now 4.3× faster than PHAST when analyzing a typical bacterial genome. More speciﬁcally, software optimizations have made the backend of PHASTER 2.7X faster than PHAST, while the addition of 80 CPUs to the PHASTER compute cluster are responsible for the remaining speedup. PHASTER can now process a typical bacterial genome in 3 min from the raw sequence alone, or in 1.5 min when given a pre-annotated GenBank ﬁle. A number of other optimizations have also been implemented, including automated algorithms to reduce the size and redundancy of PHASTER’s databases, improvements in handling multiple (metagenomic) queries and higher user trafﬁc, along with the ability to perform automated look-ups against 14 000 previously PHAST/PHASTER annotated bacterial genomes (which can lead to complete phage annotations in seconds as opposed to minutes). PHASTER’s web interface has also been entirely rewritten. A new graphical genome browser has been added, gene/genome visualization tools have been improved, and the graphical interface is now more modern, robust and user-friendly.

In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.

Most of them are very efﬁcient for short reads but inefﬁcient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and speciﬁcally tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashingbased software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.},

SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.},

Tabix is implemented as a free command-line tool as well as a library in C, Java, Perl and Python. It is particularly useful for manually examining local genomic features on the command line and enables genome viewers to support huge data ﬁles and remote custom tracks over networks.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an alternative to gene-centric metagenomics studies, enabling whole genome sequencing of uncultivated bacteria. However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly non-uniform read coverage, and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which signiﬁcantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler SPAdes to a new approach for capturing and sequencing “dark matter of life” that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the minimetagenome at once. We demonstrate that SPAdes enables sequencing mini-metagenomes and benchmark it against various assemblers. On single-cell bacterial datasets, SPAdes improves on the recently developed E+V-SC and IDBA-UD assemblers speciﬁcally designed for singlecell sequencing. For standard (multicell) datasets, SPAdes also improves on A5, ABySS, CLC, EULER-SR, Ray, SOAPdenovo, and Velvet.},
