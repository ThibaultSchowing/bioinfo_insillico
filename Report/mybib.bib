	abstract = {In recent decades, fungal infections have emerged as an important health problem associated with more people who present deﬁciencies in the immune system, such as HIV or transplanted patients. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the emerging fungal pathogens with a unique characteristic: its presence in many food products. S. cerevisiae has an impeccably good food safety record compared to other microorganisms like virus, bacteria and some ﬁlamentous fungi. However, humans unknowingly and inadvertently ingest large viable populations of S. cerevisiae (homebrewed beer or dietary supplements that contain yeast). In the last few years, researchers have studied the nature of S. cerevisiae strains and the molecular mechanisms related to infections. Here we review the last advance made in this emerging pathogen and we discuss the implication of using this species in food products.},

The arrested cells exhibit pleiotropic defects in nuclear division, maintenance of nuclear structure and heat stress responses. We previously identiﬁed a zuo1 mutation as an extragenic suppressor of the tom1 mutant. ZUO1 encodes a DnaJ-related Hsp40. Here we show that a recessive cold sensitive mutation in PDR13 coding for an Hsp70 suppressed the tom1 mutation. The pdr13 deletion mutant was sensitive to high osmolarity, just like the zuo1 deletion mutant. A zuo1 pdr13 double deletion mutant did not show additive phenotypes. Furthermore, a tagged-Zuo1p was co-immunoprecipitated with a taggedPdr13p. Taken together, we propose that Pdr13p and Zuo1p are a new pair of Hsp70:Hsp40 molecular chaperones. In addition, Pdr13p co-sedimented with translating ribosomes and this association was independent of the presence of Zuo1p. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Deletion of the entire gene (tom1-10) or the sequence encoding the HECT domain (tom1-2) causes temperature sensitivity for growth. Here we report the isolation of extragenic, recessive suppressors of tom1-2, which were designated tmr (for tom1 revertant) mutations. These were classi®ed into eight complementation groups and six of the genes were identi®ed: tmr1/cyr1, tmr2/sch9, tmr3/zuo1, tmr4, tmr5/mot1, tmr6/sse1, tmr7 and tmr8/kre6. These results suggested that the tom1 phenotype can be rescued by down-regulating the cAMP/PKA pathway. It was found that the temperature sensitivity of the tom1-2 mutant is indeed suppressed by multiple copies of PDE2 or BCY1, which encode negative regulators of the cAMP/PKA pathway. The MSN2 gene, which encodes a zinc-®nger transcription factor involved in the general stress response is also a multicopy suppressor of tom1. It was found that induction levels of both STRE-mediated (general stress response) and HSE-mediated gene expression (heat shock response) upon shift to high temperature are reduced by more than half in the tom1 mutant. Most of the isolated tmr mutations rescued one of the defects seen in both types of heat stress response in the tom1 mutant.},

	abstract = {A tom1-1 mutant was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At high temperatures, 60\% of the cells were arrested as dumbbell forms with a single large nucleus containing duplicated DNA and a short spindle. Electron-microscopy showed electron-dense structures scattered within the nucleus. Indirect immunoﬂuorescent microscopy revealed these structures to be fragmented nucleoli since the dotted structures were stained with anti-Nop1(ﬁbrillarin) antibody in large regions of the nuclei. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using oligo(dT ) revealed nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+RNA. We cloned TOM1 which encodes a large protein (380 kDa) with a hect (homologous to E6-AP C terminus)-domain at its C terminus. Deletions of either this hect-region or the entire gene made cellular growth temperature-sensitive. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved cysteine residue (tom1C3235A) in the hect-domain, supposed to be necessary for thioester-bond formation with ubiquitin, abolished the gene function. When a functional glutathione S-transferase (GST )-tagged hect protein was overproduced, it facilitated the protein conjugation with a myc-tagged ubiquitinRA, while this was not seen when GST-hect C3235A was overproduced. The protein conjugation with a hemagglutinin-tagged Smt3 was not aﬀected by the overproduction of GST-hect. Taken together, we suggest that Tom1 is a ubiquitin ligase. As a multi-copy suppressor of tom1, we isolated STM3/NPI46/FPR3 which encodes a nucleolar nucleolin-like protein. We discuss possible functions of Tom1 with respect to the pleiotropic defects of nuclear division, maintenance of nuclear structure, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Impairment of proteindegradation systems, including the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome systems, has been proposed as one of the causes of the accumulation of these aberrant proteins in AD brains. Tom1 (target of Myb1) was originally identiﬁed by the induction of its expression by the v-Myb oncogene and is a part of two major protein-degradation systems. The present study was conducted by immunohistochemical and immunoﬂuorescent stainings to show that Tom1 was localized in DNs, perisomatic granules (PSGs), and NFTs in AD brains. Moreover, in DNs, Tom1 colocalized with ubiquitin, lysosomal proteins, and Tom1-related proteins (Tollip and myosin VI), which act in both protein-degradation systems via Tom1. These results indicate that Tom1 plays important roles in protein-degradation systems in AD pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Overproduced yeast ribosomal protein (RP) Rpl26 fails to assemble into ribosomes and is degraded in the nucleus/nucleolus by a ubiquitin-proteasome system quality control pathway comprising the E2 enzymes Ubc4/Ubc5 and the ubiquitin ligase Tom1. tom1 cells show reduced ubiquitination of multiple RPs, exceptional accumulation of detergent-insoluble proteins including multiple RPs, and hypersensitivity to imbalances in production of RPs and rRNA, indicative of a profound perturbation to proteostasis. Tom1 directly ubiquitinates unassembled RPs primarily via residues that are concealed in mature ribosomes. Together, these data point to an important role for Tom1 in normal physiology and prompt us to refer to this pathway as ERISQ, for excess ribosomal protein quality control. A similar pathway, mediated by the Tom1 homolog Huwe1, restricts accumulation of overexpressed hRpl26 in human cells. We propose that ERISQ is a key element of the quality control machinery that sustains protein homeostasis and cellular fitness in eukaryotes.
	, 
	Ribosomes are the molecular machines in cells that produce proteins. The ribosomes themselves are composed of almost 80 different proteins that are held together by scaffolds made from molecules of RNA. Each protein is present in one copy, and so equal numbers of all proteins are needed to assemble a ribosome. However, because it takes many steps to produce a protein and biological processes are inherently imprecise, it is essentially impossible for a cell to produce exactly the same number of copies of all the proteins in a ribosome. Much research suggests that, to overcome these issues, a cell will make more of certain ribosomal proteins than it needs, and then degrade the leftovers that are not used. However, it was not clear how this happens, nor was it known what are the consequences of failing to degrade the leftovers.
	Now, Sung et al. show that yeast cells use an enzyme named Tom1 to attach a protein-marker called ubiquitin to ribosomal proteins that are made in excess and not assembled into ribosomes. The ubiquitin serves as a tag that marks proteins for degradation, and yeast cell that lack Tom1 fail to degrade any excess ribosomal proteins. Consequently, the mutant yeast become sensitive to any factors that alter the balance of the protein and RNA building blocks used to assemble ribosomes.
	The human equivalent of Tom1 is known as Huwe1, and the data of Sung et al. suggest that this enzyme acts in a similar pathway. Further experiments are now needed to explore the role of Huwe1 in greater depth, and investigate if problems with this enzyme are associated with any human diseases. Finally, working out the exactly how Tom1 recognizes unassembled ribosomal proteins will be another important challenge for future studies.},

By releasing intracellular enzymes, autolysis of Lactobacillus helveticus has important applications in cheese ripening as its extent varied from strain to strain. Nine genes coding PGHs were previously annotated in the genome of the high autolytic strain L. helveticus DPC 4571. This study was conducted to evaluate the clone diversity of the nine PGHs genes within a collection of 24 L. helveticus strains, highly diverse in terms of origin, biotope and autolytic activity. Pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis was applied to assess the genomic diversity of the 24 strains. The presence or absence of nine PGHs genes was veriﬁed for all L. helveticus strains. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence were compared for six relevant strains. Finally, gene expression was monitored by reverse transcription during growth and by zymogram for 12 strains. The nine PGHs genes are ubiquitous and transcripted early during growth. Zymograms were similar in terms of molecular size of the bands, but exhibited strain to strain variations in the number of bands revealing from 2 to 5 lytic bands per strain.},

However, numerous technical or computational challenges in de novo assembly still remain, although many bright ideas and heuristics have been suggested to tackle the challenges in both experimental and computational settings. In this review, we categorize de novo assemblers on the basis of the type of de Bruijn graphs (Hamiltonian and Eulerian) and discuss the challenges of de novo assembly for short NGS reads regarding computational complexity and assembly ambiguity. Then, we discuss how the limitations of the short reads can be overcome by using a single-molecule sequencing platform that generates long reads of up to several kilobases. In fact, the long read assembly has caused a paradigm shift in whole-genome assembly in terms of algorithms and supporting steps. We also summarize (i) hybrid assemblies using both short and long reads and (ii) overlap-based assemblies for long reads and discuss their challenges and future prospects. This review provides guidelines to determine the optimal approach for a given input data type, computational budget or genome.},

Although the steps in the phage identiﬁcation pipeline in PHASTER remain largely the same as in the original PHAST, numerous software improvements and signiﬁcant hardware enhancements have now made PHASTER faster, more efﬁcient, more visually appealing and much more user friendly. In particular, PHASTER is now 4.3× faster than PHAST when analyzing a typical bacterial genome. More speciﬁcally, software optimizations have made the backend of PHASTER 2.7X faster than PHAST, while the addition of 80 CPUs to the PHASTER compute cluster are responsible for the remaining speedup. PHASTER can now process a typical bacterial genome in 3 min from the raw sequence alone, or in 1.5 min when given a pre-annotated GenBank ﬁle. A number of other optimizations have also been implemented, including automated algorithms to reduce the size and redundancy of PHASTER’s databases, improvements in handling multiple (metagenomic) queries and higher user trafﬁc, along with the ability to perform automated look-ups against 14 000 previously PHAST/PHASTER annotated bacterial genomes (which can lead to complete phage annotations in seconds as opposed to minutes). PHASTER’s web interface has also been entirely rewritten. A new graphical genome browser has been added, gene/genome visualization tools have been improved, and the graphical interface is now more modern, robust and user-friendly.

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},
