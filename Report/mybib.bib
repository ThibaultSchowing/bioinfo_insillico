	abstract = {The TOM1 gene codes for a so-called HECT protein, a putative ubiquitin ligase, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the entire gene (tom1-10) or the sequence encoding the HECT domain (tom1-2) causes temperature sensitivity for growth. Here we report the isolation of extragenic, recessive suppressors of tom1-2, which were designated tmr (for tom1 revertant) mutations. These were classi®ed into eight complementation groups and six of the genes were identi®ed: tmr1/cyr1, tmr2/sch9, tmr3/zuo1, tmr4, tmr5/mot1, tmr6/sse1, tmr7 and tmr8/kre6. These results suggested that the tom1 phenotype can be rescued by down-regulating the cAMP/PKA pathway. It was found that the temperature sensitivity of the tom1-2 mutant is indeed suppressed by multiple copies of PDE2 or BCY1, which encode negative regulators of the cAMP/PKA pathway. The MSN2 gene, which encodes a zinc-®nger transcription factor involved in the general stress response is also a multicopy suppressor of tom1. It was found that induction levels of both STRE-mediated (general stress response) and HSE-mediated gene expression (heat shock response) upon shift to high temperature are reduced by more than half in the tom1 mutant. Most of the isolated tmr mutations rescued one of the defects seen in both types of heat stress response in the tom1 mutant.},

	abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process that provides cells with the molecular factories for cellular protein production. Accordingly, its misregulation lies at the heart of several hereditary diseases (e.g., Diamond-Blackfan anemia). The process of ribosome assembly comprises the processing and folding of the pre-rRNA and its concomitant assembly with the ribosomal proteins. Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis relies on a large number (N 200) of non-ribosomal factors, which confer directionality and accuracy to this process. Many of these non-ribosomal factors fall into different families of energy-consuming enzymes, notably including ATP-dependent RNA helicases, AAA-ATPases, GTPases, and kinases. Ribosome biogenesis is highly conserved within eukaryotic organisms; however, due to the combination of powerful genetic and biochemical methods, it is best studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This review summarizes our current knowledge on eukaryotic ribosome assembly, with particular focus on the molecular role of the involved energy-consuming enzymes.},

By releasing intracellular enzymes, autolysis of Lactobacillus helveticus has important applications in cheese ripening as its extent varied from strain to strain. Nine genes coding PGHs were previously annotated in the genome of the high autolytic strain L. helveticus DPC 4571. This study was conducted to evaluate the clone diversity of the nine PGHs genes within a collection of 24 L. helveticus strains, highly diverse in terms of origin, biotope and autolytic activity. Pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis was applied to assess the genomic diversity of the 24 strains. The presence or absence of nine PGHs genes was veriﬁed for all L. helveticus strains. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence were compared for six relevant strains. Finally, gene expression was monitored by reverse transcription during growth and by zymogram for 12 strains. The nine PGHs genes are ubiquitous and transcripted early during growth. Zymograms were similar in terms of molecular size of the bands, but exhibited strain to strain variations in the number of bands revealing from 2 to 5 lytic bands per strain.},

However, numerous technical or computational challenges in de novo assembly still remain, although many bright ideas and heuristics have been suggested to tackle the challenges in both experimental and computational settings. In this review, we categorize de novo assemblers on the basis of the type of de Bruijn graphs (Hamiltonian and Eulerian) and discuss the challenges of de novo assembly for short NGS reads regarding computational complexity and assembly ambiguity. Then, we discuss how the limitations of the short reads can be overcome by using a single-molecule sequencing platform that generates long reads of up to several kilobases. In fact, the long read assembly has caused a paradigm shift in whole-genome assembly in terms of algorithms and supporting steps. We also summarize (i) hybrid assemblies using both short and long reads and (ii) overlap-based assemblies for long reads and discuss their challenges and future prospects. This review provides guidelines to determine the optimal approach for a given input data type, computational budget or genome.},

The arrested cells exhibit pleiotropic defects in nuclear division, maintenance of nuclear structure and heat stress responses. We previously identiﬁed a zuo1 mutation as an extragenic suppressor of the tom1 mutant. ZUO1 encodes a DnaJ-related Hsp40. Here we show that a recessive cold sensitive mutation in PDR13 coding for an Hsp70 suppressed the tom1 mutation. The pdr13 deletion mutant was sensitive to high osmolarity, just like the zuo1 deletion mutant. A zuo1 pdr13 double deletion mutant did not show additive phenotypes. Furthermore, a tagged-Zuo1p was co-immunoprecipitated with a taggedPdr13p. Taken together, we propose that Pdr13p and Zuo1p are a new pair of Hsp70:Hsp40 molecular chaperones. In addition, Pdr13p co-sedimented with translating ribosomes and this association was independent of the presence of Zuo1p. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.
