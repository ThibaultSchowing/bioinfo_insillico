\paragraph{GAI} 

Gibberellic-Acid Insensitive (GAI) is a gene in Arabidopsis thaliana in chromosome 1 which is involved in the regulation of plant growth.  Precisely, it mediated the input signals and module the growth by decreasing the responsiveness to gibberellin\cite{peng_arabidopsis_1997}.

Gibberellin is a tetracyclic diterpenoid growth factor and influence essentially the stem elongation and other plant developmental processes\cite{hooley_gibberellins:_nodate}.

The main mutation involved a deletion of a 17 amino acid segment. The gai allele contains a deletion of 51-bp from within the GAI ORF ,from close to the N terminus and confers a dominant dwarf phenotype. The mutation take place at the DNA-binding transcription factor activity and causes a dwarf phenotype. It acts as a repressor and a coactivator of the zinc finger transcription factors GAF1/IDD2 and ENY/IDD1 in regulation of gibberellin homeostasis and signalling of the gibberellin (GA) signalling pathway. The GAI (gai1-1 and gai 1-2, two mutations on the same gene) protein as normally a length of 533 AA and is normally located in the nucleus. The deleted segment is shown in yellow for DELLA, the common one\cite{peng_arabidopsis_1997}\cite{lee_gibberellin_2002}.

If it is mutated (gai) and the plant growth better, it is a gain of function gene, in contrary it is a loss of function. The cellular gaiâ€™s component is in the nucleus and is described as a transcription region of DNA and bind it directly. The mutation in SPY (spy) is a suppressor of gai, conferring to the plant a normal phenotype. GA-deficient Arabidopsis mutants display characteristic phenotypes, including dark green leaves and a dwarf growth habit attributable to reduced stem elongation\cite{peng_arabidopsis_1997}.

The gai mutation affects GA reception or subsequent signal transduction and does not result in GA deficiency\cite{hooley_gibberellins:_nodate}.
